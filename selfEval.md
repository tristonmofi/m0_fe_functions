# Self-Evaluation

- Reflect on your learning and work today. What are you most proud of?
- I am most proud of figuring out the final function for the last problem in `function.js` it was tricky, but I was able to put the pieces of the puzzle together! I was happy that I did not use my notes. I believe there is a faster method of using a `for` loop which I will try later. I simply used `if` statements, but I believe if I can figure out how to loop everything with an if statement I could have gotten my results faster.
- In your own words, why are functions a powerful tool in our applications?
- Functions have the power of creating your own function that is not built into the system. When we create a function; we create a set of instructions and within those instructions we can use it's power for statements that repeat. 

- If I have time to figure out the loop, I will update this repo.
